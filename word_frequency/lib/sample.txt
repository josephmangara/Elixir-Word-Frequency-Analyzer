How to create a Word Frequency Analyzer Using Elixir
- I chose Elixir because it’s a niche language. 
- Learning it will enhance my backend development skills and allow exploration of the concept of building an easily scalable system. 
- The project will involve creating a program that can read a text file and count how many times each word appears. 
- It will also output a file that contains the breakdown. 
- This tool can be used by learners of a new language to identify words that occur most frequently in various texts/conversations, and study them to enhance their vocabulary. 
Summary of Elixir
Elixir is a back-end programming language that is used to build scalable and fault-tolerant systems. It runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).  Its frontend framework is Phoenix. Phoenix has useful features such as LiveView, which allows for real-time interactive interfaces with minimal JavaScript. 
Key examples of platforms that use Elixir include Discord, Pinterest, and Heroku
